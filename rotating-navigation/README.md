# Project 3: Rotating Navigation

## Initial thoughts
Woah, I have no idea how to do this one at all. I guess I'm just going to have to follow the video this time.

## Takeaways
1. I need to look up transforms. They are interesting.
2. I need to review the position property.
3. I need to look up transitions (basically all animation-related things).
