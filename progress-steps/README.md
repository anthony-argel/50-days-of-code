# Project 2: Progress Steps

## Initial Thoughts
I'm not really good with like changing divs into shapes via css so this will probably be interesting. I don't think this'll be hard to do at all, but I do think my implementation will probably be different than what Brad will show me. I also think that my implementation won't be the great.

## Thoughts after first attempt
Oh... So I manually made the progress bar. Like, each bar is actually a div. What Brad did is make 1 div and use that as a progress bar with varying widths. Pretty cool.

## Takeaways
1. Can make a progress bar using just 1 div behind everything else
2. Custom properties are interesting and something I should look into
